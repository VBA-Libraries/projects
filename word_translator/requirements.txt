VBA program to develop an MS Word Add-In which is able to convert Arabic numerals to Hindi in one click 
when I select a set of numbers in the document (not through changing the context settings in Ms-Word)

The numbers are converted between Arabic & Hindi that they maintain their correct order,
for example, the number 23,000.89 should become in Hindi 23,000.89.
